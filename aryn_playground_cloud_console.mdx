## Aryn Playground

The quickest way to experiment with the DocPrep and DocParse UIs is through the [Aryn Playground](https://play.aryn.cloud). You can access the Playground with just an Aryn Cloud API key.


## Aryn Cloud Console

You can access the Aryn Cloud console [here](https://console.aryn.cloud). 

You will need to create a password for your Aryn account the first time you login with your Aryn Cloud API key.

The console has several pages, and you can navigate to them using the left navigation panel:

* **DocPrep UI**: Create ETL pipelines to load complex, unstructured data into your vector database.
* **DocParse UI**: Visualize the segmentation (with labeled bounding boxes) and extraction of your documents.
* **Usage Dashboard**: DocParse usage data.
* **Billing Dashboard**: Billing information and monthly invoices for your account. You can also upgrade your Free Trial pricing plan to Pay As You Go (PAYG).
