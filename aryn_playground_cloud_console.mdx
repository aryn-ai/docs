## Aryn DocParse UI

The quickest way to experiment with DocParse is through the [DocParse UI](http://app.aryn.ai/docparse/). You can access the UI with your Aryn account.

The DocParse UI has several pages, and you can navigate to them using the left navigation panel:

* **DocParse**: Parse your documents. Visualize the segmentation and extraction, and download the sturctured output.
* **Storage**: Explore and search your DocSets and visualize your parsed documents. Extract additional document metadata using GenAI.
* **Tasks**: View the list pending or running Parsing and Metadata Extraction tasks.
* **Keys**: Manage your API keys.
* **Usage**: DocParse usage data.
* **Billing**: Billing information and monthly invoices for your account. You can also upgrade your Free Trial pricing plan to Pay As You Go (PAYG).
* **Settings**: Account settings.
