## Step 1: Download the Extension

First, download the appropriate `.dxt` extension file for your system:

    Download for macOS systems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Linux" icon="linux" href="https://github.com/aryn-ai/mcp-server/releases/latest/download/mcp-server-ubuntu-latest.dxt">
    Download for Ubuntu/Linux systems
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
The `.dxt` file is a Claude Desktop extension that automatically configures the MCP server for you.
</Note>

---

## Step 2: Install the Extension

1. **Locate the downloaded file** in your Downloads folder (usually named `mcp-server-macos-latest.dxt` or `mcp-server-ubuntu-latest.dxt`)

2. **Double-click the `.dxt` file** to begin installation

3. **Follow the installation prompts** - the extension will automatically configure itself

4. **Restart Claude Desktop** when prompted

<Warning>
Make sure Claude Desktop is completely closed before installing the extension. You may need to quit it from the menu bar or dock.
</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Configure Your API Key

After restarting Claude Desktop:

1. **Open Claude Desktop Settings**
   - On macOS: `Claude Desktop â†’ Preferences` or `Cmd + ,`
   - On Linux: `File â†’ Preferences` or `Ctrl + ,`

2. **Navigate to the MCP Servers section**

3. **Find "Aryn Local MCP Server"** in the list of installed servers

4. **Add your API key**:
   - Click the settings/edit button next to the Aryn MCP Server
   - Enter your Aryn API key in the `ARYN_API_KEY` field
   - If you don't have an API key, [get one free here](https://app.aryn.ai/sign-in)

5. **Set output directory** (optional):
   - Set `ARYN_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR` to your preferred download location
   - Default is usually your Downloads folder

6. **Enable the server** by toggling the switch to "On"

7. **Save and restart Claude Desktop**

<Tip>
Your API key should look like: `ey1234567890abcdef...` and start with `ey`
</Tip>

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Let's test that everything is working properly:

1. **Start a new conversation** in Claude Desktop

2. **Ask Claude to list your DocSets**:
   ```
   Can you list my Aryn DocSets?
   ```

3. **Expected response**: Claude should use the MCP server to call the `list_aryn_docsets` function and show you any existing DocSets, or indicate that you don't have any yet.

<Info>
If this is your first time using Aryn, you might not have any DocSets yet - that's perfectly normal!
</Info>

---

## Step 5: Process Your First Document

Now let's partition a PDF document. For this example, we'll use a sample document path:

1. **Prepare a PDF file** on your computer (or use any existing PDF)

2. **Ask Claude to partition the document**:
   ```
   Please partition this PDF file: /Users/yourname/Documents/sample-report.pdf
   ```
   <Note>
   Replace `/Users/yourname/Documents/sample-report.pdf` with the actual path to your PDF file.
   </Note>

3. **Claude will process the document** using the `partition_pdf` function and return:
   - Structured text content
   - Tables (if any)
   - Images (if any)
   - Metadata about the document

4. **Review the results** - you'll see the extracted content organized by type (text, tables, images)

## Step 6: Advanced Usage

Now that you have the basics working, try these more advanced features:

### Create a DocSet
```
Create a new DocSet called "financial-reports" for storing my quarterly reports
```

### Add Documents to DocSets
```
Add the document /Users/yourname/Documents/q3-report.pdf to my financial-reports DocSet
```

### Search Across Documents
```
Search my financial-reports DocSet for information about "quarterly revenue"
```

### Extract Custom Properties
```
Extract revenue and profit margin data from all documents in my financial-reports DocSet
```
