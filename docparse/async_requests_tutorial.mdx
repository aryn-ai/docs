The following functions can be used together to send files to DocParse to partition asynchronously:  

`partition_file_async_submit` - function that makes a request to partition the file and returns a task_id that you can use to keep track of your request to partition the file

`partition_file_async_result` - function that you can call to get the result of the partition_file task you just sent. It will return a dict that indicates a status (`“done”`, `“pending”` , `“failed”` or `“cancelled”`)

Here’s an example of how you can process multiple files at the same time:

```python
import time
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file_async_submit, partition_file_async_result
import os

YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME = ""
## Get a list of all files you are interested in parsing
files = os.walk(YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME)[2]
task_ids = [None] * len(files)

## Iterate through all the files to submit a task to partition each file
## and create a list of running tasks
for i, file_name in enumerate(files):
  try:
      task_ids[i] = partition_file_async_submit(file_name)["task_id"]
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Failed to submit {f}: {e}")

results = [None] * len(files)

## Wait for all tasks to finish
for i, task_id in enumerate(task_ids):
  while True:
    result = partition_file_async_result(task_id)
    # if particular task is done, break 
    if result["status"] != "pending":
      print(f"Task {task_id} done.")
      break
      
    # else sleep
    time.sleep(1)
       
  if result["status"] == "done":
    results[i] = result

## print the results, will be None if task failed
for result in results:
  print(result)
```

It is important to note that sending multiple asynchronous partitioning tasks at the same time does not guarantee that they will run simultaneously.

## Using a webHook

Optionally, you can also set a webhook for Aryn's services to call when your task is completed:

```python
partition_file_async_submit("/path/to/my/file.docx", webhook_url="https://example.com/alert")
```

Aryn will POST a request containing a body like the below to the webhook URL:

```json
{"done": [{"task_id": "aryn:t-47gpd3604e5tz79z1jro5fc"}]}
```

If you want to list all the asynchronous partition_file tasks that are running and not yet completed in your account, you can call the following function:

```python
>> partition_file_async_list()
{'aryn:t-wewbyn5zyh9uxzgghgi5ehf': {'state': 'pending'},
 'aryn:t-3kuln0wm0zqex2ks7ue0kvi': {'state': 'pending'},
 'aryn:t-o38deeglw3hkl6p939gdyyk': {'state': 'pending'},
 'aryn:t-zxzjrwmaifj8ql5ar1zttye': {'state': 'pending'},
 'aryn:t-fn6j1sbuhsohrx51r4eom9n': {'state': 'pending'},
 'aryn:t-luldbdt5d2kn8cact61mao8': {'state': 'pending'}}
```

If you want to cancel a particular asynchronous partition_file task you can call the following function: 

```python
>> partition_file_async_cancel("aryn:t-47gpd3604e5tz79z1jro5fc")
```

## Using cURL

You can also call the async APIs directly without python through cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/async/submit/document/partition -F "file=@path/to/file.pdf" -F 'options={"use_ocr": true}' -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_ARYN_API_KEY"
```

You can poll your result with the command below. Use the call id the command returned as output.

```bash
curl https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/async/result/aryn:t-bipwgqesiqixfz2kyew3j8d -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_ARYN_API_KEY"
```

To list pending tasks use the command below:

```bash
curl https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/async/list -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_ARYN_API_KEY"
```

You can cancel a pending task with the command below:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/async/cancel/aryn:t-bipwgqesiqixfz2kyew3j8d -H "Authorization: Bearer MY_ARYN_API_KEY"
```
