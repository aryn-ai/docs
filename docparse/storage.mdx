DocParse includes storage, search, and metadata enrichment for your parsed documents using DocSets in the Aryn Platform. DocParse will send the parsed output to a DocSet in the Aryn Platform, where you can use the features in the platform on this data.

You can view the bounding boxes (segmentation) and extracted elements from your documents in the [Aryn Platform DocSets UI](https://app.aryn.ai/docsets). You can also use GenAI to extract metadata from your documents, or download the parsed document. You can also search your stored documents with vector (semantic) or keyword search using the Aryn Platform UI or API.

For more information about Aryn storage limits, visit the [Aryn pricing page](https://www.aryn.ai/pricing). PAYG customers can opt-out of storing DocParse output in the Aryn Platform on the [Settings page](https://app.aryn.ai/settings).

## Adding document to storage

DocParse stores parsed documents in DocSets in the Aryn Platform, and provides a default DocSet (named `docparse_storage`) to use. Documents are automatically added to it for Free Trial customers, unless you create and specify a different DocSet. Think of a DocSet like a folder for your processed Docs, and it's optimized to store and index the elements and metadata from each Doc.

By default, DocParse will add your processed Doc to the default DocSet named `docparse_storage`. You can create a new DocSet using the Aryn UI or `create-docset` API, and specify it using the `add_to_docset_id` when partitioning a document:


```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, add_to_docset_id:[your-docset-ID])
```

You can find your DocSet ID in the DocSets page in the Aryn UI or using the `list-docsets` API.

For Pay As You Go (PAYG) customers, you can opt-out of storing your documents in two ways:

1. Specify an empty string for the `add_to_docset_id` parameter in the `Partition` API.
2. Opt-out of data storage on the Settings page in the Aryn UI. This will disable storage for all `Partition` API calls.


## Viewing stored documents

You can view the parsed documents in your DocSet on the DocSet page in the Aryn UI. Select your DocSet, and then select a Doc. In the UI, you will see the labeled bounding boxes for each element in your document, and the contents of each element. You can also view the metadata (called `properties`) extracted from your document.

You can also use the `get-doc` API to retrieve the parsed Doc, or `get-doc-binary` to get the original document.


## Extracting metadata from your documents

You can easily extract metadata (called `properties`) from your documents using GenAI for documents in Aryn DocSets. Properties are stored as part of your document in key:value pairs (property_name:property_value), and extracted using an LLM from all the documents in your DocSet. You can use the Extract Properties feature on the DocSet page or using the `extract-properties` API.

From the DocSets tab in the left nav, click on your DocSet to open it. Then, click on the Extract button, and then select Add Property. You can add up to 15 properties in the UI, and hundreds when using the API directly. Next, add the information to guide the GenAI model to properly extract your property:

`Name`: The name of the property. This is the key in the key:value pair.
`Type`: The type of value to extract. Choose between `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean`.
`Description`: The description of the property being extracted.
`Default Value`: If the LLM does not find a value to exract, this is what will be placed as the value for the property.
`Examples`: These are comma separated example property values. The LLM will use these as examples of what a value might be for a specific property.


After providing this information, click Add Property. Then, click Extract. Aryn will run a job to extract the properties specified, and share a Task ID so you can monitor the task's progress. Completed Tasks will disappear from the Tasks page when complete.

You can view your newly extracted properties when viewing a document in the DocSet by selecting the Properties tab in the Document viewer.


## Querying and searching stored documents

Now that your documents are stored in an Aryn DocSet, you can leverage the Aryn Platforms Deep Analytics and search features on this data.

### Running Deep Analytics

You can query your parsed documents using Aryn's Deep Analytics query engine. For more information on how to use a Workspace to query your data, visit the [Workspaces documentation](aryn-platform/querying-data/deep-analytics/using_workspaces).


### Using vector and keyword search

You can easily search over your documents and the associated metadata by using Aryn's search API. Once you have added documents to a docset and extracted properties, you can simply use the [Search UI](aryn-platform/querying-data/search/using_search_ui).

Here is an example of how to use the search API:

```python
from aryn_sdk.client import Client
from aryn_sdk.types.search import SearchRequest

myClient = Client()
client_response = myClient.search(
    docset_id="aryn:ds-031ppkfhkzq42baiunmr8yh",
    query=SearchRequest(
        query="weather",
        properties_filter="""(properties.entity.aircraft like "Cessna") and (properties.entity.operator <> "n/a") and (properties.entity.lowestCloudCondition = "Clear")""",
        query_type="hybrid",
        return_type="element",
    ),
)

search_results = client_response.value.results

for result in search_results:
    print(result)
```

This follows the general form:

```python
results = myClient.search(
    docset_id=[your-docset-ID],
    query=SearchRequest(
        query=[your-query-phrase],
        properties_filter=[your-boolean-filter],
        query_type=[KEYWORD | VECTOR | HYBRID | LEXICAL],
        return_type=[DOC | ELEMENT],
    ),
)
```

This will return a SearchResponse object as follows:

```
SearchResponse(results=[], query_embedding=[your-query-embedded], next_page_token=None)
```

the results parameter will be a list of either elements or documents that match the search query. To learn more about the search API please reference the sdk documentation [here](/sdk-reference/query#search).

### Filtering docs on the DocSet page

You can also filter your documents on the DocSet page. From the Storage tab, click on view to open your DocSet. Then, click on "Filter" and populate the form with your search criteria. You can specify specific properties you'd like to search on by clicking the "+Add property" button and then choosing the property you'd like to filter on.
