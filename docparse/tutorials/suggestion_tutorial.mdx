## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through an example of using DocParse to suggest properties for a document. This is useful when you have a document with a lot of properties, and you want to suggest some of the properties to the user.

## Prerequisites

1. Get your free Aryn API key by signing up on the Aryn Console at [app.aryn.ai](https://app.aryn.ai).

2. Open up the [follow-along Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18Pw_jHSpIv9vt6wMBZaIe561CPBAxaaK?usp=sharing) and copy in your API key by clicking the key icon on the leftmost side of the screen.
