## Installation

We recommend installing the Aryn SDK library using `pip`:

```python
pip install aryn-sdk
```

## Partitioning a Document
Partition a document like so:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
```

``partition_file`` takes the same options as curl, except as keyword arguments. You can find a list of options [here](./processing_options).

## Key management

By default, ``aryn-sdk`` looks for Aryn API keys first in the environment variable ``ARYN_API_KEY``, and then in ``~/.aryn/config.yaml``. You can override this behavior by specifying a key directly or a different path to the Aryn config file:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
from aryn_sdk.config import ArynConfig
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, aryn_api_key="YOUR-API-KEY")
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, aryn_config=ArynConfig(aryn_config_path="~/dotfiles/.aryn/config.yaml"))
```
## Helper Functions

``aryn_sdk`` provides some helper functions to make working with and visualizing the output of ``partition_file`` easier.

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file, table_elem_to_dataframe, draw_with_boxes
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, extract_table_structure=True, use_ocr=True, extract_images=True, threshold=0.35)

# Produce a pandas DataFrame representing one of the extracted tables
table_elements = [elt for elt in data['elements'] if elt['type'] == 'table']
dataframe = table_elem_to_dataframe(table_elements[0])

# Draw the detected bounding boxes on the pages. requires poppler
images = draw_with_boxes("mydocument.pdf", data)
```
## Different File Formats

It is easy to process files with different formats using the aryn-sdk:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mydocument.docx", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mypresentation.doc", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mypresentation.pptx", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mypresentation.ppt", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
```

## Chunking a document

Chunking support has been added in v0.1.9. You can enable the default chunking options by specifying an empty dict:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, chunking_options={})
```

Here is an example specifying certain chunking options:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, 
      chunking_options={
         "strategy": "context_rich",
         "tokenizer": "openai_tokenizer",
         "tokenizer_options": {
            "model_name": "text-embedding-3-small"
         },
         "merge_across_pages": True,
         "max_tokens": 512,
      }
   )
```

The full chunking options are documented [here](/docparse/chunking_strategies).

## Partitioning asynchronously

You can submit a job to the async DocParse API using aryn-sdk and the pattern below:

```python
import time
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file_async_submit, partition_file_async_result

with open("my-favorite-pdf.pdf", "rb") as f:
   response = partition_file_async_submit(
         f,
         use_ocr=True,
         extract_table_structure=True,
   )

job_id = response["job_id"]

# Poll for the results
while True:
   result = partition_file_async_result(job_id)
   if result["status"] != "pending":
         break
   time.sleep(5)
```

One way to do this with multiple requests at a time is shown below:

```python
import logging
import time
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file_async_submit, partition_file_async_result

files = [open("file1.pdf", "rb"), open("file2.docx", "rb")]
job_ids = [None] * len(files)
for i, f in enumerate(files):
   try:
         job_ids[i] = partition_file_async_submit(f)["job_id"]
   except Exception as e:
         logging.warning(f"Failed to submit {f}: {e}")

results = [None] * len(files)
for i, job_id in enumerate(job_ids):
   while True:
         result = partition_file_async_result(job_id)
         if result["status"] != "pending":
            break
         time.sleep(5)
   results[i] = result
```

Optionally, you can also set a webhook for Aryn's services to call when your job is completed:

```python
partition_file_submit_async("path/to/my/file.docx", webhook_url="https://example.com/alert")
```

Aryn will POST a request containing a body like the below:
```json
{"done": [{"job_id": "aryn:j-47gpd3604e5tz79z1jro5fc"}]}
```
