## Installation

We recommend installing the Aryn SDK library using `pip`:

```python
pip install aryn-sdk
```

## Partitioning a Document
Partition a document like so:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
```

``partition_file`` takes the same options as curl, except as keyword arguments. You can find a list of parameters [here](parameters_deep_dive).

## Key management

By default, ``aryn-sdk`` looks for Aryn API keys first in the environment variable ``ARYN_API_KEY``, and then in ``~/.aryn/config.yaml``. You can override this behavior by specifying a key directly or a different path to the Aryn config file:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
from aryn_sdk.config import ArynConfig
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, aryn_api_key="YOUR-API-KEY")
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, aryn_config=ArynConfig(aryn_config_path="~/dotfiles/.aryn/config.yaml"))
```
## Helper Functions

``aryn_sdk`` provides some helper functions to make working with and visualizing the output of ``partition_file`` easier.

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file, table_elem_to_dataframe, draw_with_boxes
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f, extract_table_structure=True, use_ocr=True, extract_images=True, threshold=0.35)

# Produce a pandas DataFrame representing one of the extracted tables
table_elements = [elt for elt in data['elements'] if elt['type'] == 'table']
dataframe = table_elem_to_dataframe(table_elements[0])

# Draw the detected bounding boxes on the pages. requires poppler
images = draw_with_boxes("mydocument.pdf", data)
```
## Different File Formats

It is easy to process files with different formats using the aryn-sdk:

```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file
with open("mydocument.pdf", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mydocument.docx", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mypresentation.doc", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mypresentation.pptx", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
with open("mypresentation.ppt", "rb") as f:
   data = partition_file(f)
```
