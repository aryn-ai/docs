### What's new

- Agentic Property Extraction: We’re excited to announce Agentic Property Extraction! You simply provide us a schema or use the one that DocParse suggests, and it will automatically fill in values from your documents. It not only handles atomic properties such as dates, but it also handles deeply nested data with repeated fields. It also provides element-level attribution for each property. Use it to improve your document automation workflows and more! 

Here’s the [Blog](https://www.aryn.ai/post/announcing-agentic-property-extraction-extracting-structured-data-fields-from-unstructured-documents). 
Here are some tutorials: [Property Extraction with the Aryn SDK](https://docs.aryn.ai/docparse/tutorials/extraction_tutorial), [Property Extraction with the DocParse UI](https://docs.aryn.ai/docparse/tutorials/extraction_tutorial_ui)

- Markdown grouping by page: To get the markdown output for each page, use the group_by_page markdown option, which will group the markdown output for each page in your document. [Docs](https://docs.aryn.ai/docparse/processing_options#markdown-options-group-by-page)

### Improvements

- We’ve made various bug and stability fixes that should help streamline your processing!

<Update label="September 26, 2025">

### What's new

- Aryn Local MCP Server: Aryn has a new local MCP server that can parse files, add documents, extract properties and search data. Use it to augment your favorite LLM engine, further details are [here](mcp-server/aryn_mcp).

### Improvements

- Improved inline text extraction: We've addressed an issue in inline text extraction (when text_mode is set to `auto` or `inline_fallback_to_ocr`) that could have slowed down your document processing.

<Update label="September 11, 2025">

### What's new

- New Region Availability - EU: Aryn now supports processing and data storage in the EU region (`EU Central - Frankfurt`). Simply switch your setting in the UI or instantiate a client with the region specified to take advantage of this! More information is [here](docparse/quickstart#switching-regions)
- Auto text mode: Our text_mode now defaults to `auto`, a new text mode that intelligently uses a combination of inline extraction and OCR to surface the best outputs for you. All previous options continue to be supported! More information is [here](docparse/processing_options#text-mode).

### Improvements

- Tables fixes: We’ve fixed a number of bugs with our table post processing that should help you get better outputs and cleaner visualizations! Try it now on the UI and via the API.

<Update label="August 11, 2025">

### What's new

Aryn DocParse now supports HTML as output, simply specify `html` in the [output_format](docparse/processing_options#output-format) option. This is useful when converting documents for RAG and other LLM-based applications.

### Improvements

- We've improved the performance of document listing by 10x, which is especially beneficial for customers that have hundreds of thousands to millions of documents.
- We've made Aryn console more interactive and responsive for large and dense tables.

### What's new

- Aryn DocParse now supports parsing files referenced from URLs. You can pass in pre-signed URLs from Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or elsewhere. Aryn efficiently and reliably parses the linked files without cumbersome file management on the client side. For more information, visit [the Aryn documentation](https://docs.aryn.ai/docparse/aryn_sdk#urls-as-input).
- Aryn DocParse also now supports linking the captions associated with an image in a document. Simply add `image_extraction_options: {'associate_captions': true}` and you get images expanded to encompass the captions. For more information, take a look at [the Image Extraction tutorial](https://docs.aryn.ai/docparse/tutorials/images#captions).

### Improvements

We've improved the performance and overall look and feel for DocSet browsing and the DocParse UI. [Try it out](https://app.aryn.ai/docparse) and let us know what you think!

<Update label="July 28, 2025">
### What's new

We're proud to announce that Aryn has attained SOC 2 Type II and ISO 270001 compliance! We've always cared deeply about our customer's data security, privacy, and availability. This certification validates what we've been doing all along — going beyond the industry's best practices to protect our customer's data — not once but continuously.

### Improvements

We improved the throughput of our VLM-based document processing by more than 100%. This improves both VLM-based table extraction (`table_mode` = `vision`) and VLM-based OCR (`text_mode` = `vision_ocr` ), allowing you to process twice the number of pages in the same time budget. [Try it out on your most complex docs.](https://app.aryn.ai/docparse)
