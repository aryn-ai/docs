### What's new

We're proud to announce that Aryn has attained SOC 2 Type II and ISO 270001 compliance! We've always cared deeply about our customer's data security, privacy, and availability. This certification validates what we've been doing all along — going beyond the industry's best practices to protect our customer's data — not once but continuously.

### Improvements

We improved the throughput of our VLM-based document processing by more than 100%. This improves both VLM-based table extraction (`table_mode` = `vision`) and VLM-based OCR (`text_mode` = `vision_ocr` ), allowing you to process twice the number of pages in the same time budget.
