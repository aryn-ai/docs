You can access the Aryn Cloud console [here](https://console.aryn.cloud). 

You will need to create a password for your Aryn account the first time you login.

The console has usage and billing information for your account. You can also upgrade your Free Trial pricing plan to Pay As You Go (PAYG) on the [Billing page](https://console.aryn.cloud/billing).

Through the [playground](https://play.aryn.cloud/choose) on the console, you can test the Aryn API with your own documents. The console has two parts:

- **Aryn DocParse**: Allows you to extract tables, images and more from your documents in a structured format.
- **Aryn DocPrep**: Allows you to extract, chunk, and load documents into your preferred vector database.
