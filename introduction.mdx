Aryn is an LLM-powered data preparation, processing, and analytics system for complex, unstructured documents like PDFs, HTML, presentations, and more. With Aryn, you can prepare data for GenAI and RAG applications, power high-quality document processing workflows, and run analytics on large document collections with natural language. It includes two components: Aryn DocParse and Sycamore.

Aryn DocParse (ADP) formerly known as the Aryn Partitioning Service, is a serverless, GPU-powered API for segmenting and labeling PDF documents, doing OCR, and extracting tables and images. It returns the output in JSON. ADP runs the Aryn Partitioner and its state-of-the-art, open source
[deep learning AI model](https://huggingface.co/Aryn/deformable-detr-DocLayNet) trained on 80k+ enterprise documents. 
You can use it to partition documents and extract information directly in your code, or use it with Sycamore for additional processing. [Sign-up here for free](https://www.aryn.ai/get-started)_ to get an API Key and use the [Aryn Playground](https://play.aryn.cloud/partitioning) to visually see how it segments and processes your own documents. 
Or, watch Aryn DocParse in action in [this video](https://www.aryn.ai/?name=ArynPartitioningService_Intro).


## Key Features

* **Powerful and accurate document segmentation for complex documents with tables, images, text, infographics, and more.**  Aryn's vision-based segmentation models provide 11+ class labels, and are up to 6x better in mean average precision (mAP) and 4x better in mean average recall (mAR) than existing solutions.

* **Developer-focused reliable and flexible document processing engine with Sycamore.** Similar to Apache Spark, but for handling and processing unstructured document collections at scale. Easily process document collections using sophisticated data transforms and LLMs, while maintaining overall document lineage using Sycamore's DocSet abstraction. Create better chunks and extract higher quality metadata, leading to 30% better recall and 2x better accuracy on real-world use cases.

* **Scalable, fault-tolerant, and reliable loading of vector DBs and search indexes.** Generate vector embeddings using your choice of model, easily build knowledge graphs, and other output formats from your unstructured data. Targets include leading engines like Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Weaviate, Pinecone, DuckDB, Qdrant and more. Aryn can seamlessly handle millions of documents.

* **Plug-and-Play LLMs.** Use different LLMs for entity extraction, vector embedding, and post-processing steps.
