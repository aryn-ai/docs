Outside of using Aryn's agentic query engine, you can run direct search queries on your DocSet. Aryn is built on OpenSearch, and leverages its keyword and vector indexing for this feature set. 

You can query your DocSet using the Search UI in the Aryn Console. To learn more about building a search application with the Aryn SDK, [click here](/sdk-reference/query#search).


### Running a search query

Navigate to the Search UI using the left nav, and select your DocSet to search using the dropdown to the left of the search bar. Next, select your Search Type, which includes:


* Hybrid: Combines keyword and vector search.
* Vector (Semantic): Finds similar items in a dataset by comparing their numerical representations (vector embeddings) using a k-NN algorithm.
* Lexical: Uses the BM25 algorithm, a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. The search call will perform an exact string match and return results where the query string shows up as a standalone word.
* Keyword: The search call will perform a substring match and return results that contain strings that contain the query term specified.

Aryn's search will return the most relevant Document chunks in your DocSet. If you click on a chunk, you will see the full document and other relevant chunks in that document in the Document Viewer.


### Using filters for fine-grained search

You can specify one or more filters on Properties in your DocSet in your search queries. To add a filter, click the Filters button on the right hand side under the search query text box. Select your Property, Operator, and Value. The filters use an exact match, if using the ```equals``` operator.

Click Add Filter, and you will see the filter added under the search query text box. You can remove it by clicking the "x" on the filter. You can also add additional filters.

When you are finished adding filters, you can run your search query. You can add additional Properties to use with filters through Extract Properties or using Sycamore document ETL.
