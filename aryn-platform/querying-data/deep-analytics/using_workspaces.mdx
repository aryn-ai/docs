The easiest way to get started with Deep Analytics is by using Aryn's Workspaces UI. Deep Analytics is the ability to run complex, multi-operation analytics queries on your unstructured data at scale, and it is enabled by Aryn's agentic query engine.

A Workspace enables several interactions:

* Run iterative natural language queries on a DocSet
* Retrieve the results of a query, which can include text, tables, and lists of relevant documents
* Save the results of a query as a Bookmarked DocSet, and query the Bookmark
* Adjust the query plan in natural language before running it
* View the input and output into each query step (for debugging purposes)


## Running a query

Go to the Workspace UI by clicking on it in the left nav, and then select the DocSet you want to query. Or, go to your DocSet in the DocSet list page and click the Query button.

Once you have selected your DocSet in the Workspace UI, type in a query in natural langauge in the textbox. Aryn will then generate and display a plan for your query. You can choose to edit the plan (see the section below) or run it.
