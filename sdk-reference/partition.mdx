## Synchronous Partitioning Functions
### partition_file

Sends a file to Aryn DocParse and returns a Python dictionary with elements containing its document structure and text.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Parameters">
- `file`: Required. A `file` opened in binary mode to parse or a path expressed as a `str` or a `PathLike` object specifying where the file to parse is.
- `threshold`: A `float` between `0.0` and `1.0`, inclusive, which serves as a cutoff to determine which bounding boxes for the file are returned or a string `auto` (the default) where the service uses a processing method to find the best prediction for each possible bounding box. 
Only bounding boxes that the model predicts with a confidence score higher than the threshold specified will be returned. A lower value will 
include more objects but may have overlaps, while a higher value will reduce the number of overlaps but may miss legitimate objects. If you do
set the threshold manually, we recommend starting with a value of `0.32`.
- `use_ocr`: A boolean value that, when set to `True`, causes DocParse to extract text using an OCR model. This is useful when the text is not directly extractable from the PDF, such as when the text is part of an image or when the text is rotated. When set to `False`, DocParse extracts embedded text from the input document. Default is `False`.
- `extract_table_structure`: A boolean that, when `True`, enables DocParse to extract tables and their structural content using a purpose built table extraction model. If set to `False`, tables are still identified but not analyzed for their structure; as a result, table cells and their bounding boxes are not included in the response. Default is `False`.
- `table_extraction_options`: A map with string keys specifying options for table extraction, which currently only supports the boolean `include_additional_text`, which will add in text from OCR boxes. When include_additional_text is set to true and table extraction is enabled, DocParse will attempt to enhance the table structure by merging in tokens from text extraction. This can be useful for working with tables that have missing or misaligned text. `include_additional_text` is `False` by default. The default table_extraction_options is `{}`.
- `extract_images`: A boolean that determines whether to extract images from the document. Default: `False`.
- `ocr_images`: A boolean that, when `True`, causes DocParse to use OCR to attempt to generate a text representation of detected images. When `False`, images do not contain a text_representation. Default is `False`.
- `ocr_language`: A string that specifies the language to use for OCR. The default is `english` (English). The full list of supported languages can be found [here](../docparse/formats_supported).
- `selected_pages`: A list specifying individual pages (1-indexed) and page ranges from the document to partition. Single pages are specified as integers and ranges are specified as lists with two integer entries in ascending order. A valid example value for selected_pages is `[1, 10, [15, 20]]` which would include pages 1, 10, 15, 16, 17 ..., 20. `selected_pages` is `None` by default, which results in all pages of the document being parsed.
- `chunking_options`: A dictionary of options for specifying chunking behavior. Chunking is only performed when this option is present, and default options are chosen when `chunking_options` is specified as `{}`.
    - `strategy`: A string specifying the strategy to use to combine and split chunks. Valid values are `context_rich` and `maximize_within_limit`. The default and recommended chunker is `context_rich` as `{'strategy': 'context_rich'}`.
        - Behavior of `context_rich` chunker: The goal of this strategy is to add context to evenly-sized chunks. This is most useful for retrieval based GenAI applications. Context_rich chunking combines adjacent `section-header` and `title` elements into a new `section-header` element. Merges elements into a chunk with its most recent `section-header`. If the chunk would contain too many tokens, then it starts a new chunk copying the section-header to the start of this new chunk and continues. Merges elements on different pages, unless `merge_across_pages` is set to `False`.


        - Behavior of `maximize_within_limit` chunker: The goal of the `maximize_within_limit` chunker is to make the chunks as large as possible. Merges elements into the last most recently merged set of elements unless doing so would make its token count exceed `max_tokens`. In that case, it would keep the new element separate and start merging subsequent elements into that one, following the same rule. Merges elements on different pages, unless `merge_across_pages` is set to `False`.
    - `max_tokens`: An integer specifying the cutoff for splitting chunks that are too large. Default value is 512.
    - `tokenizer`: A string specifying the tokenizer to use when determining how characters in a chunk are grouped. Valid values are `openai_tokenizer`, `character_tokenizer`, and `huggingface_tokenizer`. Defaults to `openai_tokenizer`.
    - `tokenizer_options`: A nested dictionary with string keys specifying the options for the chosen tokenizer. Defaults to `{'model_name': 'text-embedding-3-small'}`, which works with the OpenAI tokenizer.
        - Available options for `openai_tokenizer`:
            - `model_name`: Accepts all models supported by OpenAI's [tiktoken tokenizer](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken). Default is "text-embedding-3-small"
        - Available options for `HuggingFaceTokenizer`:
            - `model_name`: Accepts all huggingface tokenizers from the [huggingface/tokenizers repo](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).
        - `character_tokenizer` does not take any options.
    - `merge_across_pages`: A `boolean` that when `True` the selected chunker will attempt to merge chunks across page boundaries. Does not apply to the `mixed_multi_column` merger, which never merges across pages. Defaults to `True`. 
- `output_format`: A string controlling the output representation. Defaults to `json` which yields an array called `elements` which contains the partitioned elements, represented in JSON. If set to `markdown` the service response will instead include a field called `markdown` that contains a string representing the entire document in Markdown format.
- `output_label_options`: A dictionary of options to specify which heuristic to apply to enforce certain label outputs. If this option is not specified, no heuristic is applied. The options the dictionary supports are listed below.
    - `promote_title`: A boolean that specifies whether to promote an element to title if there's no title in the output. 
    - `title_candidate_elements`: A list of strings that are candidate elements to be promoted to title.
    - `orientation_correction`: A boolean value that specifies whether to correct the orientation of rotated pages during the preprocessing step.
- `aps_url`: A `string` specifying the URL of the Aryn DocParse endpoint. Default URL: "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition".
- `ssl_verify`: A `boolean` that controls whether the client verifies the SSL certificate of the chosen DocParse server. ssl_verify is `True` by default, enforcing SSL verification.
- `aryn_config`: An ArynConfig object (defined in [aryn_sdk/config.py](https://github.com/aryn-ai/sycamore/blob/main/lib/aryn-sdk/aryn_sdk/config.py)), used for finding an api key. If aryn_api_key is set it will override this. The default ArynConfig looks in the env var `ARYN_API_KEY` and then in the file ~/.aryn/config.yaml. Default is None (aryn-sdk will look in the aryn_api_key parameter, in your environment variables, and then in ~/.aryn/config.yaml).
- `aryn_api_key`: An Aryn API key, provided as a string. You can get one for free at [aryn.ai/get-started](https://www.aryn.ai/get-started). Default is `None` (If not provided, the sdk will check for it in the environment variable `ARYN_API_KEY` or will look in aryn_config as specified above).

## Helper Functions

### convert_image_element

Convert an image element to a more usable format. If no format is specified, create a PIL Image object. If a format is specified, output the bytes of the image in that format. If `b64encode` is set to `True`, base64-encode the bytes and return them as a `string`.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Parameters">
- `elem`: Required. An image element from the `elements` field of a `partition_file` response.
- `format`: A `string` specifying the format to output bytes to. Default is `PIL`.

### draw_with_boxes

Create a list of images from the provided PDF, one for each page, with bounding boxes detected by the partitioner drawn on.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Parameters">
- `pdf_file`: Required. A PDF file opened in binary mode or a path to a PDF file expressed as a `string` or a `PathLike` object upon which to draw.
-`partitioning_data`: Required. The output from `partition_file`.
- `draw_table_cells`: A boolean that when `True`, makes the function draw individually detected cells of tables. When `False`, the bounding boxes of table cells are not drawn but the outer bounding boxes of tables and the bounding boxes of all other elements are still drawn. Default is False.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example">
```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file, draw_with_boxes

with open("my-favorite-pdf.pdf", "rb") as f:
    data = partition_file(
        f,
        aryn_api_key="MY-ARYN-API-KEY",
        use_ocr=True,
        extract_table_structure=True,
        extract_images=True
    )
pages = draw_with_boxes("my-favorite-pdf.pdf", data, draw_table_cells=True)
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Return Value">
A list of images of pages of the PDF, each with bounding boxes drawn on.

</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Exceptions">
-  Will throw an exception if the function is not called with a PDF file.

### table_elem_to_dataframe

Create a `pandas` DataFrame representing the tabular data inside the provided table element. If the element is not of type `table` or doesn't contain any table data, return `None` instead.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Parameters">
- `elem`: Required. An element from the 'elements' field of a `partition_file` response.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Example">
```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file, table_elem_to_dataframe

with open("partition-me.pdf", "rb") as f:
    data = partition_file(
        f,
        use_ocr=True,
        extract_table_structure=True,
        extract_images=True
    )

# Find the first table and convert it to a dataframe
df = None
for element in data['elements']:
    if element['type'] == 'table':
        df = table_elem_to_dataframe(element)
        break
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Return Value">
A Pandas DataFrame representing the tabular data inside the provided table element. If the element is not of type 'table' or doesn't contain any table data, returns None instead.

</Accordion>

### tables_to_pandas

For every table element in the provided partitioning response, create a pandas DataFrame representing the tabular data. Return a list containing all the elements, with tables paired with their corresponding DataFrames.


<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Parameters">

- `data`: A response from `partition_file`

</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Example">
```python
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file, tables_to_pandas

with open("my-favorite-pdf.pdf", "rb") as f:
    data = partition_file(
        f,
        aryn_api_key="MY-ARYN-API-KEY",
        use_ocr=True,
        extract_table_structure=True,
        extract_images=True
    )
elts_and_dataframes = tables_to_pandas(data)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Return Value">

A list of tuples, where each tuple contains an element from the 'elements' field of a `partition_file` response and a Pandas DataFrame representing the tabular data inside the provided table element. If the element is not of type 'table' or doesn't contain any table data, the DataFrame will be `None`.
