title: 'Async Partition Submit'
openapi: 'post /v1/async/submit/document/partition'
---
This is the Aryn DocParse API for submitting a document to be partitioned (and optionally chunked) asynchronously. Use
[the async partition result API](./async-partition-result) to poll the asynchronous partitioning job and get its result
when it's done.

This takes all the same parameters as the [synchronous partitioning endpoint](./partition.mdx) and in addition accepts a webhook url in the
optional header `X-Aryn-Webhook`. When the task stops running, Aryn will POST to the provided webhook url with a body
like the one below:

```json
{
  "done": [
    {
      "task_id": "aryn:t-47gpd3604e5tz79z1jro5fc"
    }
  ]
}
```
