You can use Aryn DocParse to easily chunk and extract data from complex documents. DocParse accepts PDF, Microsoft Word (.docx and .doc), Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx and .ppt) and [more](aryn_docparse/formats_supported). It can extract paragraphs, tables and images. It returns detailed information about the components it has just identified in a JSON object.  The following two sections will walk you through two examples where we segment PDF documents and extract a table and an image from those documents using the python aryn-sdk.

- [Table Extraction From PDF](./aryn_docparse/tables.mdx)
- [Image Extraction From PDF](./aryn_docparse/images.mdx)

There are three ways to use Aryn DocParse: through the ``aryn-sdk`` client, through the ``ArynPartitioner`` in Sycamore, and directly from the HTTP service.

To follow along below, we will need an Aryn Cloud API key, which we can get for free at [aryn.ai/get-started](https://www.aryn.ai/get-started). You will recieve the API key in your email inbox.

## Using the ``Aryn-SDK``

The ``aryn-sdk`` client is a thin python library that calls the Aryn DocParse and provides a few utility methods around it. It is the easiest way to add Aryn DocParse to your applications or custom data processing pipelines. You can view an example in [this notebook](https://github.com/aryn-ai/sycamore/blob/main/notebooks/ArynPartitionerPython.ipynb).

For more information, see the [Aryn SDK documentation](./aryn_docparse/aryn_sdk.mdx).

## Using Sycamore's Partition transform

Aryn DocParse (formerly known as the Aryn DocParse) is the default option when specifying the Aryn Partitioner in a Sycamore script. Say you have a set of pdfs located at the path stored in ``work_dir``. We partition these documents with the code snippet below:

```python
aryn_api_key = "PUT API KEY HERE"

ctx = sycamore.init()
pdf_docset = context.read.binary(work_dir, binary_format="pdf")
partitioned_docset = pdf_docset.partition(ArynPartitioner(aryn_api_key=aryn_api_key))
```
Alternatively, we can store our Aryn API key in ``~/.aryn/config.yaml`` like so:

```yaml
aryn_token: "PUT API KEY HERE"
```
Which makes our Sycamore script the following:

```python
ctx = sycamore.init()
pdf_docset = context.read.binary(work_dir, binary_format="pdf")
partitioned_docset = pdf_docset.partition(ArynPartitioner())
```

If you are processing a large PDF with OCR, you might benefit from using the ``pages_per_call`` option. This is only available when using the Partition function in Sycamore. This option divides the processing of your document into batches of pages, and you specify the size of each batch.

## Using ``curl``

We recommend using the Aryn SDK, but you can also use ``curl`` to access Aryn DocParse directly.

``curl`` an example document to use with the partitioning service if you do not have one already.

```bash
curl http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762 -o document.pdf
```
Change ``PUT API KEY HERE`` below to your Aryn API key. If you have a different document, change ``@document.pdf`` to ``@/path/to/your/document.pdf`` below.

```bash
export ARYN_API_KEY="PUT API KEY HERE"
curl -s -N -D headers "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARYN_API_KEY" -F "pdf=@document.pdf" | tee document.json
```
Your results have been saved to ``document.json``.

```bash
cat document.json
```

### Different File Formats

```bash
export ARYN_API_KEY="PUT API KEY HERE"
curl -s -N -D headers "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARYN_API_KEY" -F "pdf=@document.pdf" | tee document.json
curl -s -N -D headers "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARYN_API_KEY" -F "pdf=@document.docx" | tee document.json
curl -s -N -D headers "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARYN_API_KEY" -F "pdf=@document.doc" | tee document.json
curl -s -N -D headers "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARYN_API_KEY" -F "pdf=@document.pptx" | tee document.json
curl -s -N -D headers "https://api.aryn.cloud/v1/document/partition" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ARYN_API_KEY" -F "pdf=@document.ppt" | tee document.json
```
